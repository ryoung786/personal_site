name=Olympus&desc=Olympus is the newly renovated study area / computer room.  Soon to be equipped with a handy Athena station or two (hence the name Olympus), this room actually might be useful.  For years it was just a closet full of shit, and a bunch of memory on a shelf, but now you can actually see the carpet!
