name=The Kitchen&desc=The basement is a place so freaking sweet you will piss your pants once you see it.  No, seriously.  There's a pool table, some couches, and even 2 huge refrigerators that we can't get rid of down there.  Foosball in one corner (watch out the table's kinda crooked), a TV mounted on the wall, and an unlimited supply of snacks and beverages courtesy of the well-stocked dungeon.
