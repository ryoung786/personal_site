	  Antichess was my project for 6.170, a software dev class at MIT.  Sorry it's packaged in the strange JNLP format, but I figure even now that's still the best way to distribute it over the web.  Java webstart is weird.  <a href="old/antichess/jaws.jnlp">Click</a> to play.

	  The rules are a bit odd.  If I remember correctly, the goal is to lose all of your pieces first.  You can also win if you checkmate the other player (much harder to do than in regular chess), or if your opponent's time runs out.  If you can take a piece, you must.

	  I apologize in advance for the terrible useability.  The deadline was tight, and we were a team of 2 working on a project designed for teams of 3 or 4.  But I am generally happy with the end result, given that it was my first sizeable software project.  Enjoy!
